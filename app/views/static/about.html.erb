<h2>Why Amble?</h2>

<p>
  Amble was written to help you explore the environment around you; to discover places close by that will help you experience all that Victoria has to offer. Inspired by the incredibly functional user interface of apps like Urbanspoon, we wanted to create a mobile application to help Victorians and tourists discover interesting new places in Victoria quickly and easily.
</p>
  
<p>
  The initial concept: visitors of Victoria travel around with ideas in mind of places to see and activities to do.  At any one of these places, Amble can be used to find other places of interest nearby; be it landmarks, art galleries, restaurants, etc.
</p>
  
<p>
  While we initially envisioned Amble being used only by tourists, the application also stands on it's own as being a useful tool to Victorians to discover new places in their familiar environment.
</p>

<blockquote>
  In short: explore the environment around you&hellips; help you experience all that Victoria has to offer.
</blockquote>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
  The main goal of Amble was, as with all good mobile applications, to get the relevant data to the user as quickly and as beautifully as possible. Further, we focussed on the following:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Clear, graphical Places.</em>
      <p>Mobile users don't have the time or screen real estate to read long descriptions. A picture tells a thousand words. However, more information is only a click away.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Simple Sign-on and Sociability.</em>
      <p>We chose to use Facebook Connect to make log in as simple as possible  for the vast majority of users. This enables users to share and visit places together.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Simple Interface.</em>
      <p>
        We pared the features down to the absolute minimum required, in order to build a great product that is instantly usable by anyone.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Great Data.</em>
      <p>
        Our initial data set is comprised of data provided by the Victorian Government meshed with high quality Creative Commons imagery from Flickr. In particular, we used the 'Art Places', 'Licensed Venues' and the 'Australian Tourism Data Warehouse' data to seed our data set. Whenever possible, we cross referenced links to external sites such as Citysearch.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Our goals: to craft a more human approach to discovery&hellips; to encourage activity and meaningful connections.

  "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"
  - Antoine de Saint-Exupery.
  
  Although we had many great ideas for features that would make the product even useful to our users, we wanted to craft an app that would convey the core idea without distraction.
  
  Some features that we will consider adding in the future include:
  <ul>
    <li>Further social aspects; ratings and comments on places.</li>
    <li>User driven content; allow users to add and edit places.</li>
    <li>Show all places near you in a map based interface with routing capability.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
  Initially we decided Amble would be most useful to mobile users. As we are familiar with the iPhone platform, we began with an iPhone application, however we quickly decided that we needed to be able to reach a greater audience.
</p>
  
<p>
  So we created a mobile web application. Although it was developed primarily for the iPhone, it works on the Android platform, and could be expanded to support the features available on other smart phones in future versions.
</p>

<p>
An added benefit of this approach is that it was simple to create a website
accessible from any computer. Although not as useful to such users as it is to
mobile users on the go, we envisage users using the website to plan trips before time. This approach also allows us to provide a fully accessible W3C compliant experience that is compatible with hearing and visually impaired browsers.
