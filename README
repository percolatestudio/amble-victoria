== Amble - Victoria in your pocket

This is the source code to our entry for the 2010 App My State Competition 
in Victoria, Australia.

Amble is a cross platform mobile web application that is designed to replace
a paper based city guide. It returns stunning images of tourist locations
that are close by allowing the user to add them as favourites and share them
with friends via facebook and twitter.
